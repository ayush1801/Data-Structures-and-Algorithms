there are some functions which need description

mainrec.c : driver program for checking recursive mergesort
mainiter.c : driver program for checking iterative mergesort
mergerec.c : recursive mergesort
mergeitr.c : iterative mergesort

rest are self explanatory

for measuring space the difference is in recursive
procedure itself because of recursive calls while for different input
(1024/10240) iterative procedure remains same.

please provide neccessary arguments for makefile
($make compRecMS compIterMS runRecMS runIterMS compare)

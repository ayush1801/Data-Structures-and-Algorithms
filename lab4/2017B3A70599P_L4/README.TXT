cycle1.c : Hare and Tortoise Algorithm
cycle2.c : Link Reversal Algorithm
linkedlist.h : contains description of several functions created for operations in linkedlist

retNodebe and retNodebc are two functions created for returning node by element checking and returning node by index checking respectively.

mem2.h and mem2a.c are files associated with myalloc and myfree functions

driver.c: driver file for ex4;
driver5.c: driver file for ex5;

exe1: executable linked with cycle1.c
exe2: executable linked with cycle2.c
exe5: executable based on ex5;

command line arguments to be passed:
exe  filename  num_of_nodes_needed

exe: exe1/exe2/exe5
filename: Owrite.c/Owrite5.c depending upon the executable
num_of_nodes_needed: number of nodes that are needed to be calculated

prof_output_1/2 contains running time information of 1 cr nodes

time_1/2 are executables associated with these

RunningTimeGraph.png: shows the running time which clearly shows that average running time taken by link reversal algorithm is more as compared to hare and tortoise algorithm.
